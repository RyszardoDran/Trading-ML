# GitHub Configuration

This directory contains repository-level configuration and assets that tailor GitHub and GitHub Copilot to this project. It centralizes:
- Copilot repository instructions and guidance
- Custom Agents used in Copilot Chat (new format)
- Custom Chat Modes used in Copilot Chat (deprecated, for backward compatibility)
- Reusable Prompt files (slash commands)
- Instruction files for languages/domains
- GitHub Actions workflows (CI/CD) scaffolding

Audience: maintainers and contributors configuring Copilot or repository automation.

Scope: This README documents the `.github/` directory only. For project-wide overview and concepts, see the root [README.md](../README.md) (especially “Copying Copilot Customisations”).

### Copying Copilot Customisations

The custom agents, chat modes, instructions, and prompts are designed to be portable across repositories with the same directory layout. For general guidance and caveats, see the root [README: “Copying Copilot Customisations”](../README.md#7-copying-copilot-customisations).

Most files contain **HTML comments** inlined with additional context (functionality, intent, and prompting techniques). View the raw source to see these notes.

## GitHub Copilot Customisation

The [copilot-instructions.md](copilot-instructions.md) file contains the main instructions for GitHub Copilot.

It defines mandatory development workflows (branching, commit and PR conventions), coding standards, and review/quality gates using clear, machine-parseable XML-style tags (for example, <CRITICAL_REQUIREMENT/>). Copilot and other AI assistants use these rules to stay consistent with your team’s process.

Key SSOT anchors:
- Quality & Coverage Policy: [copilot-instructions.md#quality-policy](./copilot-instructions.md#quality-policy)
- Branching & Workflow, Naming, Commit Conventions: see relevant sections in the same file

### Custom Agents

- [Custom Agents](./agents/README.md)

> **Note:** As of October 2025, GitHub renamed "Chat Modes" to "Agents". See [GitHub's announcement](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-10-28-custom-agents-for-github-copilot/) for details.

Agents provide specialized behaviors in Copilot Chat (e.g., Developer, Code Review, Testing). Each agent documents its persona, process, constraints, and available tools. Files live under `./agents/` and use the `.agent.md` extension.

Available agents:
- **Developer** - Test-driven development with quality gates and design-first methodology
- **Code Reviewer** - Systematic code review with best practices enforcement
- **Tester** - BDD-focused testing approach with comprehensive test coverage

> **Note:** VS Code now ships with built-in Planner and Documentation agents. This repository provides complementary agents that don't duplicate those built-in capabilities.

### Custom Chat Modes (Deprecated)

- [Custom Chat Modes](./chatmodes/README.md) *(deprecated)*

> ⚠️ **DEPRECATED**: The `.github/chatmodes/` directory is maintained for backward compatibility with VS Code. New development should use the `.github/agents/` directory with the `.agent.md` extension.

Chat Modes provide specialized behaviors in Copilot Chat (e.g., Developer, Code Review, Documentation, Testing, Planner). Each mode documents its persona, process, constraints, and available tools. Files live under `./chatmodes/` and use the `.chatmode.md` extension.

### Custom Instructions

- [Custom Instructions](./instructions/README.md)

Instruction files are small, focused rule sets with optional frontmatter (e.g., `applyTo`) that scope guidance to specific files or languages. They help Copilot generate code and docs that match project standards. Notable files include (SSOTs):
- `backend.instructions.md` (Java/Python/C# backends)
- `frontend.instructions.md` (TypeScript/React conventions)
- `docs.instructions.md` (applies to all `**/*.md`)
- `bdd-tests.instructions.md` (applies to `**.feature`)

### Custom Prompts

- [Custom Prompts](./prompts/README.md)

Reusable prompts act like slash commands in Copilot Chat (e.g., `/write-adr`, `/write-prd`, `/write-docs`, `/copilot-setup-check`). They standardize inputs and output structure for common tasks and can create or edit files when approved.

## GitHub Actions Customisation

The `./workflows/` folder holds GitHub Actions. It’s currently empty and ready for CI/CD jobs (for example: lint Markdown, validate instruction frontmatter, run tests). Add workflow files as needed following standard GitHub Actions practices. Prefer referencing SSOT anchors (e.g., Quality Policy) in validation jobs.
